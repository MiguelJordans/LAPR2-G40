# US 3 - RegisterClient

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a receptionist of the laboratory, I want to register a client.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

* **From the Specifications Document:** 

>"In case of a new client, the receptionist registers the client in the application." *(Pag. 2, ln. 1)*
>
>"To register a client the receptionist needs the clientâ€™s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number, birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIF), phone number, e-mail and name." *(Pag. 2, ln 1-3)*

* **From the client clarifications:**

>**Question:** Does the receptionist need to be logged in the app to perform the registration?
> 
>**Answer**: Yes.


>**Question:** What parameter (asked by the receptionist) should the system use to create the password of the new client?
> 
>**Answer:** The password should be randomly generated. It should have ten alphanumeric characters.


>**Question:** Relative to registering a new user, how should the system respond in the event of creating a new client with the same attributes of an already existing one?
>
>**Answer:** This should be treated as an error. A subset of the attributes of any client are unique.


>**Question:** When the receptionist is doing the client registration, does he need to pay?
>
>**Answer:** There are costs and payments but they are managed by a third party and are outside of the system. Therefore, in this project we will not consider the cost and payments associated with each test.


>**Question:** To register a Client which is the format of each attribute?
>
>**Answer:**
> * Citizen Card: 16 digit number
> * NHS: 10 digit number
> * TIN: 10 digit number
> * Birth day: in which format: DD/MM/YYYY
> * Sex: should only be Male/Female or include more options.
> * Phone number: 11 digit number
> * The sex is opcional. All other fields are required.


>**Question:** During the registration of a client, if he gives a phone number already used by another customer, should the registration continue normally or should it be canceled?
>
>**Answer:** The e-mail address and phone number should be unique for each user. The system should present a message informing about the error and asking for a different phone number.


>**Question:** how are the passwords delivered to the clients?
>
>**Answer:** Each client receives an e-mail informing that the registration was successful and that he can start to use the system. The e-mail includes the client password.


>**Question:** After being registered by the receptionist, should the client receive some kind of confirmation e-mail in order to finish his registration?
>
>**Answer:** The client only receives an e-mail informing that the registration was successful and that he can start to use the system. The e-mail includes the client password.


>**Question:** How should the system send a email to the client with the password?
> 
>**Answer:** Considering a set of technical restrictions, during the development of the Integrative Project we will not use any e-mail or SMS API services to send messages. 
> All the e-mail and SMS messages should be written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt. This file simulates the use of e-mail and SMS API services.


>**Question:** Do clients have to change their password after registration? (first login)
> 
>**Answer:** No.


>**Question:** Can they change their password whenever they want?
> 
>**Answer:** No. For now, there are no user story or use case to update the password.


>**Question** Does the email have to be validated as a valid address or do we just accept whatever input the receptionist writes?
> 
>**Answer** You should use a regular expression to validate the e-mail address.


>**Question** Also, does the phone number has to be validated as a valid phone number? And can it be registered with a prefix (+44) or just the number?
> 
>**Answer** This lab only operates in England, there is no need to use the prefix.


>**Question** Is there any restrictions to the client age?
> 
>**Answer** A client should not have more than 150 years of age. Although there are important developments in the pursuit of eternal youth, for now this value is ok.


>**Question** What should be the maximum length of the String with the name of the Client?
> 
>**Answer** A string with no more than 35 characters.


>**Question** Should each client have an unique ID, generated during their creation?
> 
>**Answer** No.




### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The client must become a system user. The "auth" component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications).
* **AC2:** The password should be randomly generated.
* **AC3:** The password should have 10 alphanumeric characters.
* **AC4:** The creation of a new client with the same attributes of an aleardy existing one should be treated as an error.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step/Msg 1: Starts the registration of a new client |	...interacting with the actor | ClientRegistrationUI | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model |
| Step/Msg 1: Starts the registration of a new client | ...coordinating the US? | ClientRegistrationController | It's a controller | 
| Step/Msg 1: Starts the registration of a new client | ...instantiating a new client? | Company | The company knows the client. |
| Step/Msg 1: Starts the registration of a new client | ...knowing which user is using the system? | UserSession | IE: cf. A&A component documentation |
| Step/Msg 1: Starts the registration of a new client | ...knowing to which organization the user belongs to? | System | n/a |
| Step/Msg 2: Requests data (name, citizen card number, phone number, email, TIF number, NSH number, sex, birth date) |	n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Step/Msg 3: Types requested data | ...saving the inputted data? | ClientRegistration | IE: object created in step 1 has its own data. |
| Step/Msg 4: Shows the data and requests confirmation | ...validating the data locally (e.g.: mandatory or non-mandatory data)? | Company | IE: knows its own data. |
| Step/Msg 5: Confirms the data | ... saving the created clinical analysis laboratory? | Company | IE: adopts/records all the ClinicalAnalysisLaboratory objects |
| Step/Msg 6: Informs the operation success | ...inform the operation success? | ClientRegistrationUI | IE: responsible for user interaction |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * UserSession
 * System
 * ClientRegistration

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * ClientRegistrationUI  
 * ClientRegistrationController
 * ClientRegistrationStore

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US003_SD](US003_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests

## AC5

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Client with a blank attribute (E.g.: name). 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void checkNameBlank() {

        ClientRegistration cr = new ClientRegistration("", "2344@gmail.com", "Male", "23/06/1999",
                "5647748895858574", "05968742634","7468496874", "7456375876");

    }

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Client with an oversized attribute (E.g.: name).
 
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void checkNameIsTooBig() {

        ClientRegistration cr = new ClientRegistration("The biggest and most unnecessary name you'll ever read", "2344@gmail.com", "Male", "23/06/1999",
                "5647748895858574", "05968742634", "7468496874", "7456375876");

    }

**Test 3:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Client with an oversized attribute (E.g.: name).

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void checkNameIsInvalid() {

        ClientRegistration cr = new ClientRegistration("xXVenomShock99Xx", "2344@gmail.com", "Male", "23/06/1999",
                "5647748895858574", "05968742634", "7468496874", "7456375876");

    }

#### This kind of tests are made to all the other attributes (with some exceptions).
