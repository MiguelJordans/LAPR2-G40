# US 9 - Specify test and its collecting methods

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*- As an administrator, I want to specify a new type of test and its collecting methods.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the Specifications Document:**

>"Once there, a receptionist asks the clientÂ´s citizen card number, the lab order (which contains the type of test and parameters to be measured), and registers in the application the test to be performed to that client".
>
> "Many Labs performs two types of tests. Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS code, a description that indetifies the sample collection method, the date and time when the samples were collected, the date and time of the chemical analysis, the data and time of the diagnosis made by the specialist doctor, the date and time when the laboratory coordiantor validated the test, and the test type(whether it is blood test or Covid test)"

**From the client clarifications:**

>**Question**: Does a type of test holds any attribute besides its name and collecting methods?
>
>**Answer**: The attributes for a new test type are: description, collecting method and each test type should have a set of categories. Each category should be chosen from a list of categories. Each category has a name and a unique code. There are no subcategories. There exists only one collection method per test type.

>**Question**: Are the collecting methods stored simpled as a word or a sentence, or does it also must contain its description, and/or another attributes?
>
>**Answer**: To make a Covid test you need a swab to collect a sample. To make a blood test you need sample tubes and a syringe.
When the administrator (US9) specifies a new type of test, the administrator also specifies the method to collect a sample. The administrator introduces a brief description for specifying the collecting method. There exists only one collection method per test type.

>**Question**: Are there any different collecting methods other than the ones currently known? Which ones?
>
> **Answer**: Each collecting method is associated with a test type. Whenever a test type is created a collecting method should be defined.
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Code has five alphanumeric characters.
* **AC2:** The code is not automatically generated.
* **AC3:** The administrator introduces a brief description for specifying the collecting method.
* **AC4:** Description is a string with no more than 15 characters.
* **AC5:** Collecting method is a string with no more than 20 characters.
* **AC6:** Each category has a name and a unique code. There are no subcategories.
* **AC7:** There exists only one collection method per test type.
* **AC8:** Each collecting method is associated with a test type.
* **AC9:** Whenever a test type is created a collecting method should be defined.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
